#__CONTROL__

# The above can also be specified as follows:
#control[01:03]     ansible_ssh_user=kolla

# The network nodes are where your l3-agent and loadbalancers will run
# This can be the same as a host in the control group

#__COMPUTE__

# When compute nodes and control nodes use different interfaces,
# you can specify "api_interface" and another interfaces like below:
#compute01 neutron_external_interface=eth0 api_interface=em1 storage_interface=em1 tunnel_interface=em1

# Additional control implemented here. These groups allow you to control which
# services run on which hosts at a per-service level.
#
# Word of caution: Some services are required to run on the same host to
# function appropriately. For example, neutron-metadata-agent must run on the
# same host as the l3-agent and (depending on configuration) the dhcp-agent.
